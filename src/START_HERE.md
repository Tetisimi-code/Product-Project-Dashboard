# 👋 Start Here: Team Access Issue

## 🚨 Current Problem

Your authentication system works perfectly, but there's **one limitation**:

```
Only this email can sign up right now:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ tetisimi.sanni@gmail.com │
└─────────────────────────┘

All other emails (including @reactive-technologies.com) are blocked.
```

## ✅ The Solution (15 minutes)

**Verify your domain in Resend** - this is:
- ✅ **Free** (no cost)
- ✅ **Quick** (15-30 minutes)
- ✅ **Simple** (mostly copy-paste)
- ✅ **One-time** (do it once, works forever)

After setup:
```
✅ tetisimi.sanni@gmail.com
✅ alice@reactive-technologies.com
✅ bob@reactive-technologies.com  
✅ anyone@reactive-technologies.com
```

## 🤔 Common Questions

### Q: Why is this happening?

**A:** Resend's free tier only allows sending to the account owner's email. This is normal for testing. To send to other emails, you need to verify your domain.

### Q: Will this cost money?

**A:** No! It's completely free. Resend free tier includes 3,000 emails/month.

### Q: How long does it take?

**A:** 15-30 minutes total:
- 5 min: Add domain in Resend
- 5 min: Add DNS records  
- 5-15 min: Wait for verification
- 2 min: Update code

### Q: Is it hard?

**A:** No! It's mostly copy-paste. Our guides walk you through every step.

### Q: What if I don't have DNS access?

**A:** Forward the DNS records to your IT department or domain administrator. Takes them 5 minutes.

### Q: Can I skip this?

**A:** For now, yes - you can use `tetisimi.sanni@gmail.com` for testing. But you'll need domain verification before your team can use the app.
